Introduction
============

Mathematical modeling is a widely used tool to describe, understand and predict further behavior of living systems.
In particular, in the field of Predictive Biology, one can find a large variety of works that dwell on building models of different levels of complexity controlled by model parameters, e.g., to describe bacteria growth :cite:p:`bernaertsConceptsToolsPredictive2004`.
Based on a chosen model structure, these parameters can be estimated from the gathered experimental data.
Taking into account that the real experimental data always contains measurement noise, the parameter estimates can be only provided with some uncertainty. 
To decrease the error of the parameter values, not only enough experimental data should be gathered but the quality of this data is also pretty sufficient.
That rises quite an important question of finding the Optimal Experimental Design where optimized experimental conditions and/or times allow one to reduce the number of measurements without loss of information thus sparing an effort of experimenters :cite:p:`derlindenImpactExperimentDesign2013, balsa-cantoe.bangaj.r.COMPUTINGOPTIMALDYNAMIC2008`.
